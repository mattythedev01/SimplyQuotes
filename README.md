### Approval Process

1. **Submission**: Users can submit new quotes for review.
2. **Moderation**: A designated moderator will review the submitted quotes.
3. **Approval**: Once approved, the quote will be added to the database.
4. **Global Visibility**: Approved quotes will then be available to be visible to every quote channel that was setup using the bot.

This ensures that the content shared within SimplyQuotes is curated and maintains a standard of quality.
